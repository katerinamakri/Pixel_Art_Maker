# Project: Pixel Art Maker
Google Developer Challenge Scholarship_ Front-End Web Dev


In this challenge, we built a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
The users are able to:
* Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
* Choose a color.
* Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with chosen color.
